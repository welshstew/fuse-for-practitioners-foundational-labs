== Use Case 3 - Camel Route publishing the messages into a queue and handling the DLQ messages

The purpose of this use case is to extend/revisit the use case 1 to publish the JSON messages into different queues instead of the folders outbox and error.
For the erroneous messages, you will replace the DLQ folder with a DLQ queue and will develop a strategy to update/correct the erroneous messages
and re inject these messages into the normal flow.

A notification/alert mechanism will also be developed to send a message into a topic
to which a client is connected to be informed about the error reported for the faulty messages. The erroneous message and the message code
received will be saved into a error table.

.Goals
* Combine the Routing and Integration technology with a messaging platform
* Develop a project able to use locally Apache ActiveMQ or JBoss A-MQ to publish the messages into different queues
* Use the DLQ pattern supported by Apache ActiveMQ / JBoss A-MQ
* Notify the client using a topic that erroneous messages have been produced
* Report the error within a database

== Import the Project (TODO - Discuss how we will setup the project)

. In JBoss Developer Studio, switch to the *Git* perspective. 
. Click the icon at the top to clone a Git repository and add the clone to this view.
. In the *URI* text box, copy and paste the following: 
+
------
https://github.com/gpe-mw-training/fuse-for-practitioners-labs.git
------
+
. Switch to *Project Explorer* for the *JBoss* perspective.
. Import a new Maven project by selecting *File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven Projects -> Next*. Import the `core` and it's parent project
. Navigate to the location of the Git projects for the Data Transformation tool and click *Finish*.
. Click the *Project Explorer* tab and expand the `Inbound` project node. 
+  
.Application structure

. Examine the following files and folders that appear in the expanded view:

* `routing`: module in which you will develop the `route`, `unit test` of the use-case.
** `src/main/resources/schema` : JSON and csv schemas files you will need to create the Data Transformation
* `parent` : Contain JBoss Fuse 6.2.1 dependencies, properties definition and maven plugins used by the modules
* `features` : Apache Karaf XML features file to be used to deploy the `usecase` project on JBoss Fuse without Fabric technology



=== Build the `routing` Project & test it locally

. On the command line, run the following commands:

[source]
----
mvn clean install
mvn camel:run
----

=== Bonus

Define the features XML file to deploy the project on JBoss Fuse 6.2.1 and test it using these commands to be executed within the Fuse console.

[source]
----
addurl mvn:org.fuse.usecase/features/1.0/xml/features
features:install usecase-camel-bindy-json
----

Instead of using the features XML file, you can also create a Fabric8 profile by editing the <fabric8.xxxx> xml tags that you have within the pom.xml routing file
and next execute this command to create the profile into JBoss Fuse Fabric

[source]
----
mvn fabric8:deploy
----
